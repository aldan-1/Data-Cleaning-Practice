# Data-Cleaning-Practice
This practice helps me learn more about data cleaning and analytics. This project aims to investigate the key factors that can influence students' exam performance. 
This project is still a work in progress so future updates will come soon.

To ensure the project's flow, it will follow the 6 steps of data analysis as posted by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-data-analysis-expert-guide).

- Step 1: `Defining objectives and questions`
- Step 2: `Data collection`
- Step 3: `Data cleaning`
- Step 4: `Data analysis`
- Step 5: `Data interpretation and visualization`
- Step 6: `Data storytelling`

Steps 2 - 4 will be done in `Jupyter`, and steps 5 - 6 will be done in `PowerBI`
